e)  Branches can be used when two developers are developing different features for the project and then want to
    merge the two when both are finished with their respective coding. Another use of branches is to have different versions
    of the same system that (perhaps) require slightly different code to run on a different machine.

f)  Git log shows the history of commits that were made whereas the git status shows the differences between the index file
    and the current head commit.

g)  git log --follow Weapons.h

h)  git log --grep=<file>

i)  Inheritance: The ability of objects to take on properties of existing objects.
    Polymorphism: A programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.
    Encapsulation: Binding together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

    Polymorphism is being used in this instance because the Weapons class distributes different functionality on
    the core variables through the use of different types of weapons classes. An example of this would be that the CommonSpear weapon
    can interact with damage values of the characters by inheriting variables from the Weapons abstract class.
